# Southern_Water_Corp_Case_Study
 Southern Water Corp is one of the largest desalination plants in Israel, retailing fresh, desalinated water for residential, public, and private consumption. To fulfil the increasing need of the customers the company had to maximize the availability of its desalination plants. This results in increased revenues but also increase in maintenance costs. In case of pump failure (if happens) the company must take appropriate measures to balance out the maintenance costs, operating costs and revenues so that company wonâ€™t experience any losses.
